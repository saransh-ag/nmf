# Non negative matrix factorisation
The objective of this assignment is to write a new implementation of the Euclidean distance formulation of Non-negative Matrix Factorization (NMF) as proposed by Lee & Seung, which is outlined in the resources. This implementation should be suitable for application to text data, in the form of a sparse term-document matrix.
